##  Strategy/Scope

"PsalmPonder" is a fictional name created for a Bible-themed Hangman game. The name is a combination of "Psalm," referring to the Book of Psalms in the Bible, and "Ponder," suggesting reflection or contemplation. The idea behind the name is to convey the notion of thoughtful engagement with words related to Psalms through a word-guessing game.

In the context of the game, players are encouraged to ponder and reflect on words associated with Psalms as they guess and unveil the hidden words. The combination of gaming elements with a biblical theme aims to provide an entertaining and educational experience for players interested in the Book of Psalms and related concepts.
